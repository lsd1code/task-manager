# Task Manager

+ First, we need to set up a git repo
  + project directory
  + initializing git
  + project structure

+ Create a `TaskManager` class 
  + adding a task
  + listing tasks -> all, completed, not-completed
  + deleting tasks
  + mark task as completed -> task the id and sets the value to true
  + use the array list as the internal data structure

+ Create the UI (text-based) using the Scanner class
  + main loop
  + add
  + list 
  + delete
  + mark as complete
  + exit program
  + handle user inputs using switch statements

+ Validation and Error handling
  + checking if a task exists before removing it
  + handling invalid input arguments
  + input mismatch
